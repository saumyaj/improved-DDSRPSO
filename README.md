# improved-DDSRPSO

This is a Matlab implementation of an improved variant of Directionally Driven Self-Regulating Particle Swarm Optimizer algorithm. 

The algorithm can be tested using a set of 28 test functions provided in cec13_func file. These functions can be found [here](https://al-roomi.org/multimedia/CEC_Database/CEC2013/RealParameterOptimization/CEC2013_RealParameterOptimization_TechnicalReport.pdf).  

To test the code just run main.m. The code was written using Matlab 2017. So some of the functions used might not work in older versions.
